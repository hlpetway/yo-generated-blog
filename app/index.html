        <h3><a href="#">Mending Wall</a></h3>
        <h6>Written by <a href="#">Robert Frost</a> and posted on May 8, 2014.</h6>
 
        <div class="row">
          <div class="large-6 columns">
            <p>Something there is that doesn't love a wall, 
            that sends the frozen-ground-swell under it, 
            and spills the upper boulders in the sun; 
            and makes gaps even two can pass abreast. 
            The work of hunters is another thing: 
            I have come after them and made repair 
            where they have left not one stone on a stone, 
            but they would have the rabbit out of hiding, 
            to please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean, 
            no one has seen them made or heard them made, 
            but at spring mending-time we find them there. 
            I let my neighbour know beyond the hill; 
            and on a day we meet to walk the line 
            and set the wall between us once again. </p>
            <p>We keep the wall between us as we go. 
            To each the boulders that have fallen to each. 
            And some are loaves and some so nearly balls 
            we have to use a spell to make them balance: 
            "Stay where you are until our backs are turned!" 
            We wear our fingers rough with handling them. 
            Oh, just another kind of out-door game, 
            one on a side. It comes to little more: 
            There where it is we do not need the wall: 
            He is all pine and I am apple orchard. 
            My apple trees will never get across 
            and eat the cones under his pines, I tell him. </p>

        <p>He only says, "Good fences make good neighbours." 
        Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder 
        if I could put a notion in his head: 
        "Why do they make good neighbours? Isn't it 
        where there are cows? But here there are no cows. 
        Before I built a wall I'd ask to know 
        what I was walling in or walling out, 
        and to whom I was like to give offence. 
        Something there is that doesn't love a wall, 
        that wants it down."</p>
 
        <p>I could say "Elves" to him, But it's not elves exactly, and I'd rather he said it for himself. I see him there bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top 
        In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed. 
        He moves in darkness as it seems to me, 
        not of woods only and the shade of trees. 
        He will not go behind his father's saying, 
        and he likes having thought of it so well 
        he says again, "Good fences make good neighbours." </p>

            <p>I WHISPERED, 'I am too young,'
            and then, 'I am old enough';
            Wherefore I threw a penny
            to find out if I might love.</p>
            <p>'Go and love, go and love, young man,
            if the lady be young and fair.'
            Ah, penny, brown penny, brown penny,
            I am looped in the loops of her hair.</p>

        <p>O love is the crooked thing, there is nobody wise enough to find out all that is in it, for he would be thinking of love till the stars had run away
        and the shadows eaten the moon.</p>
 
        <p>Ah, penny, brown penny, brown penny,
        one cannot begin it too soon. </p>

        <p>I'd like to get away from earth awhile and then come back to it and begin over. May no fate willfully misunderstand me and half grant what I wish and snatch me away not to return. Earth's the right place for love: I don't know where it's likely to go better.</p>
